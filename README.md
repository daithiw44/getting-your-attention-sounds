Getting the attention of fellow workers who wear headphone can be a tricky thing. This repo addresses that issue by allowing you send attention getting audio messages as links to those headphone wearing colleagues in a format they can hear.

Copy link of sound file you want to play into an IM and when the headphone wearing colleague clicks on the IM link they will here your attention getting sound and know you want to contact them. GENIUS.

*tested in google chat/messenger and skype.
